                <p>The survey was carefully <strong>co-designed with community leaders</strong> from various tech and creative communities in Tirana to ensure relevance and accessibility. To maintain data quality, we implemented <strong>attention check questions</strong> (such as "If you are really reading this, select option X") throughout the survey. Only 4 responses failed these validation checks and were excluded from analysis, ensuring the reliability of our findings.</p>

                        <strong>Low Frequency of Engagement:</strong>
                        <p>Most people participate rarely in events (38.7%), clearly signifying that more work needs to be done from the communities to allow for retention and more frequent participation. Furthermore, if we consider frequent attendees that participate in events once a month and/or more than once a month, only 18% of the respondents can be classified as such.</p>

                        <strong>Social Media & Word of Mouth Dominance:</strong>
                        <p>Most events are discovered through social media, more specifically Instagram coming in first place (72%). However, surprisingly "Word of Mouth" comes in second place before any other social media (65.5%). The conclusion that can be derived is that community managers and specifically the team responsible for communication and marketing can have an initial idea on how to distribute the budget for social media promotion. However, it must not be forgotten that word of mouth is still very important and impressions and experiences drive further participation.</p>

                        <strong>Strong Preference for In-Person Events:</strong>
                        <p>The data clearly show a stronger preference for in-person events, though online ones have some traction as well. Even for tech communities that could be thought to be in the forefront of the usage of software tools for community engagement, the preference for in-person events is by far stronger than that for online ones, where 75% chose 3, the highest scale of preference for in-person events compared to 43% choosing the same preference level for online events.</p>

                    <div class="recommendation-item">
                        <strong>Knowledge-Driven Participation:</strong>
                        <p>In terms of the reasons people participate in the events organized by the communities, 84% of the respondents chose as the most important motivation "gaining new knowledge". The second most voted reason was "deepening knowledge". This highlights the fact that the participants are very knowledge-driven and the organizers of communities should pay careful attention to the substance of the events as opposed to more secondary factors.</p>

                    <h3>⚠️ Main Challenges Identified</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Through two open-ended questions, we identified the main challenges people encounter when they participate in community-driven events:</p>
                    
                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Challenge 1: Lack of Engagement (28.8%)</strong>
                        <p>The top challenge was one that the researchers labeled as "engagement" or lack thereof. In essence, many people felt that the events were not engaging enough, for example some stating they were only superficial presentations and not allowing space for discussion.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Challenge 2: Overall Organization (24%)</strong>
                        <p>The second top challenge referred to "overall organization", such as but not limited to: timing, disorganized logistics, technical issues, etc.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Challenge 3: Content Issues (20%)</strong>
                        <p>The third challenge refers to issues related to the "content", such as but not limited to: the superficiality of the content, a too theoretical approach, getting out of topic, etc.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Other Challenges</strong>
                        <p>The other challenges referred to "authenticity and value doubt" where the respondents doubted the value of the events and thought they were fictitious; inner-outer group dynamics between the organizers or frequent attendees and the rest of the audience; and scheduling issues.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Top Suggestion: New Knowledge & Content (18%)</strong>
                        <p>The top suggestion was to introduce "new knowledge and content" in order to boost the motivation to participate. This is a reinforcement of the fact that the participants are knowledge-driven, a conclusion that emerged throughout the study.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Second Priority: More Engagement (15.6%)</strong>
                        <p>Make the events more engaging by allowing for more space for discussions and having the organizers serve as facilitators for wider engagement during the event and not only with the people they are already familiar with. This would require the organizers to truly inhabit their role and become genuine community builders.</p>

                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Third Priority: Networking Opportunities (14.2%)</strong>
                        <p>Create structured opportunities for participants to connect with each other, not just with speakers or organizers.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sub-challenge">
                        <strong>Additional Suggestions</strong>
                        <p>Other suggestions encompassed: introducing "transactional values" in events such as food, drinks, or other tangible benefits; a "clear agenda" of what the events will comprise; and matters of content such as depth and practicality to ensure true learning.</p>
